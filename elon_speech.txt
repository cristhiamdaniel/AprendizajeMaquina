If you go back say, 300 years, the things we take for granted today, 
you’d be burned at stake for. Being able to fly. That’s crazy. 
Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, 
having effectively with the Internet as a group mind of sorts, 
and having access to all the world’s information instantly from 
almost anywhere on the earth. This stuff that really would 
be magic – that would be considered magic in times past.
